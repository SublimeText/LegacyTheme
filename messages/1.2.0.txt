Theme - Legacy (previously Retina)

1.2.0 Rename
-----------------------

"Theme - Retina" has been transferred to the Sublime Text Package org on Github:
https://github.com/SublimeText

In addition, to signify its new role as a time-capsule for the pre-3.0 look of
Sublime Text, it has been renamed from "Retina" to "Legacy". As a result, you
will have to re-select it as your active theme.

To do so, please open the command palette, choose "UI: Select Theme", and look
for the "Legacy.sublime-theme" option.
