## Installing
Install via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Retina) and change the UI theme via the command palette.

## Contributing
artwork.sketch contains all the assets, so if any graphics need to be changed please do so there and an export should update all the png files.
